Through this blog, I aim to share my knowledge, tools and experiences as a security researcher and provide the infosec community with helpful tips and resources. I am a firm believer in the power of thecommunity and the significance of knowledge sharing.

I work as a senior security consultant and penetration tester by day. and bug bounty hunter by night. I have been listed in the hall of fame of several well-known companies, such as: 
-   Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/thanks/   Year:2017
-   Google: https://bughunters.google.com/profile/936e28a5-6312-4f90-8946-dd6204a81886
-   Deutsche Telekom AG: https://www.telekom.com/en/company/data-privacy-and-security/news/acknowledgements-358300
-   Others ...

Recently, however, I have been focusing more on hacking on HackerOne, Iâ€™m known as [**sandh0t**](https://hackerone.com/sandh0t).

In my daily work, I engage with clients and developers to assess their requirements, carry out penetration testing, prepare comprehensive reports, and assist the clients in comprehending the potential risks and remedying the discovered vulnerabilities.

Thank you for visiting my blog. I hope you find the content informative and engaging, and I welcome your feedback.
