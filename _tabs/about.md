Through this blog, I aim to share my knowledge and experiences as a security researcher and provide the infosec community with helpful tips and resources. I am a firm believer in the power of community and the significance of knowledge sharing.

By day, I am a Senior Security Consultant and Penetration Tester, and by night, I become a Bug Bounty Hunter. During my free time, I primarily focus on hacking on Hackerone, where I am known as [**sandh0t**](https://hackerone.com/sandh0t).

I am proud to be an OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) and OSCE (Offensive Security Certified Expert) certified professional, demonstrating my expertise in various security methodologies, techniques, and tools.

Thank you for visiting my blog. I hope you find the content informative and engaging, and I welcome your feedback."
